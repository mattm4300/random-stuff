# Changes to Make for Assgn2 Redo+ **[DONE]** Move the stderr print out for "value X not found" when deleting to the modules themselves, not bstrees.  + **[DONE]** This needs to happen for both vbst and rbt.    + **[DONE]** This means that I *should* define a deleteRBT function-- and all it should do is print the "value x not found" error message if that value isn't there.  It won't actually delete.+ String memory management is messed up somewhere, most likely in the cleaning b/c I was getting "<?>" style characters in the stored strings.  + Need to add a clean to inserted strings from the command files.  **[DONE]** To do this I need to fix setString & newString.+ Need to download Lusth's test files and make sure they all run correctly before resubmission  + **[DONE]** What is the command to download these though??+ Program needs to be able to handle *all* alpha chars, including those not in standard ASCII codes.+ Need to move the changes made to string class over to master folder for string.c & string.h.
