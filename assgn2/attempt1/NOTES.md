# Changes to Make for Assgn2 Redo+ Move the stderr print out for "value X not found" when deleting to the modules themselves, not bstrees.  + This needs to happen for both vbst and rbt.    + This means that I *should* define a deleteRBT function-- and all it should do is print the "value x not found" error message if that value isn't there.  It won't actually delete.+ String memory management is messed up somewhere, most likely in the cleaning b/c I was getting "<?>" style characters in the stored strings.+ Need to download Lusth's test files and make sure they all run correctly before resubmission  + What is the command to download these though??
