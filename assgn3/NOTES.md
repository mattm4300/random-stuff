# Where I left off:# To-do:+ Check for updates to the assignment pages & check against current code.# Programming Notes:+ We **must** follow the pseudocode for binomial heaps from the beastie website.+ **Let the smallest vertex in the graph be the source vertex. If, after running Djikstra's algorithm and there are unreachable vertices, run the algorithm again (and again) with the smallest unreached vertex. Repeat this process as long as necessary.**+ **Note: a null pointer may be passed in as the updater, if this feature is not needed by the application. In this case, the updater function is never called. **
