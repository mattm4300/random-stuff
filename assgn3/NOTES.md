# Where I left off:+ Fixed the DArray memory issue.+ Start on binomial heap.+ Check the Forums, is the algorithm djikstra's or modified prim's?# To-do:+ Read about djikstra's algorithm.+ Look back over binomail heaps and priority queues.+ Make the module files.# Programming Notes:+ We **must** follow the pseudocode for binomial heaps from the beastie website.+ **Let the smallest vertex in the graph be the source vertex. If, after running Djikstra's algorithm and there are unreachable vertices, run the algorithm again (and again) with the smallest unreached vertex. Repeat this process as long as necessary.**
